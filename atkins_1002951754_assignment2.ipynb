    "### Converting Categorical Data Into Numerical Data\n",
    "There are a few options for encoding categorical data into numerical data. Given a categorical column we can choose to either encode each element numerically, encode the column using one-hot encoding, or encode the column using a custom one-hot encoding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the dataset in question is a dataset that contains information regarding which car each respondent owns. The column in question is ```car_type```. This column can take on 3 different values: ```tesla```, ```toyota```, and ```bmw```. The following will demonstrate three different types of encoding methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numerical Encoding \n",
    "To numerically encode the ```car_type``` category we would assign the possible values that ```car_type``` could be as numerical values. We could encode ```tesla``` as 0, ```toyota``` as 1, and ```bmw``` as 2. The problem with this encoding method is the weighting implied by the numerical values. Are BMW's twice as valuable, heavy, or fast as Toyotas? If the data does not relate to the encoding in any way it is better to use one-hot encoding instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "To encode a column using one-hot encoding we assign each possible value in a particular column its own column. Then, the values in each of these new columns is either 0 or 1 depending on if that particular entry possesses that property. ```tesla```, ```toyota```, and ```bmw``` would all be separate columns with boolean values in each entry. The drawback of one-hot encoding is the number of columns explodes with the number of unique values in each categorical column. In this rather simple example we added an additional 2 columns. If we repeated this process for a large number of categorical columns with many unique values in each column we would end up with a very large dataset that would take a long time to operate on. A potential solution is delinated by the next method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Customized One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "Suppose that in our example there are a total of 1000 respondents. 975 respondents own Teslas, 15 own BMWs, and 10 own Toyotas. In this case, it might be wiser to refactor our original ```car_type``` column to a more simple binary column like ```owns_tesla```. This would prevent an explosion of columns and would retain the attractive categorical implications of one-hot encoding. One could also situationally create a column called ```other``` that would encompass all of the other entires for a given dataset to refrain from adding several columns containing little information. Critically thinking about which encoding method you should use is essential for generating accurate models. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Column Visualization\n",
    "Each column must be investigated to determine which encoding method should be used for each column."

    "#### Gender Encoding (Q2)\n",

The vast majorty of respondents are \"Male\" or \"Female\". Using one-hot encoding we will define three columns: \"Male\", \"Female\", and \"Other\". In this way we save a column without sacrificing too much information.\n",

Our dataset would explode in size and the information gained from this explosion would not be worth it. Instead of dropping the column we will atempt to find some sort of middle ground.

    "#### Current Role (Q5)\n",

Given that there are not many possible replies we will one-hot encode this column\n",

    "This column includes information regarding money spent on machine learning products in the past 5 years. Given that ranges were provided these values will be numerically encoded. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis Tools (Q14)\n",
    "The recorded responses provide insight into which analysis tools the respondents prefer. These were originally encoded using one-hot encoding and then further encoded using numerical encoding to further desribe the similarities between responses. They will be re-encoded using one-hot encoding because the similarities between responses is difficult to interpret without one-hot encoding every single response as its own column.\n",
    "\n",

    "Respondents were asked to recommend a programming language to an aspiring data scientist. The vast majority of replies were \"Python\", but many other languages were also recommended.

    "By dropping all of the NaN values we lose about 1.7k survey results. This is too many results to sacrifice. We could choose to set all of the NaN values to the mode of the categorical data, however, give the sheer magnitude of the NaN values we would just be enforcing the mode and creating potentially statistically significant results based off of nothing. The columns that contain the most amount of NaN values are Q22 and Q23. We will drop these columns and replace the NaN values present in the other numerically encoded data with the modes of each column. "
